I'm experimenting with a program to understand how input conditions influence its worst-case performance, particularly in terms of finding the longest execution path as the input size increases. By conducting a worst-case analysis, I aim to identify constraints that define a valid input set at different input sizes (N). So far, I have found one possible set of correct constraints/conditions (not the only one) that characterize such valid inputs. Here they are:

The constraints for input (N=1):

None


The constraints for input (N=2):

(assert  ( =  in1x0 in0x1))


The constraints for input (N=3):

(assert (and (and  ( =  in1x0 in0x1)  ( =  in2x0 in0x2))  ( =  in2x1 in1x2)))


The constraints for input (N=4):

(assert (and (and (and (and (and  ( =  in1x0 in0x1)  ( =  in2x0 in0x2))  ( =  in2x1 in1x2))  ( =  in3x0 in0x3))  ( =  in3x1 in1x3))  ( =  in3x2 in2x3)))


The constraints for input (N=5):

(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and  ( =  in1x0 in0x1)  ( =  in2x0 in0x2))  ( =  in2x1 in1x2))  ( =  in3x0 in0x3))  ( =  in3x1 in1x3))  ( =  in3x2 in2x3))  ( =  in4x0 in0x4))  ( =  in4x1 in1x4))  ( =  in4x2 in2x4))  ( =  in4x3 in3x4)))


The constraints for input (N=6):

(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and  ( =  in1x0 in0x1)  ( =  in2x0 in0x2))  ( =  in2x1 in1x2))  ( =  in3x0 in0x3))  ( =  in3x1 in1x3))  ( =  in3x2 in2x3))  ( =  in4x0 in0x4))  ( =  in4x1 in1x4))  ( =  in4x2 in2x4))  ( =  in4x3 in3x4))  ( =  in5x0 in0x5))  ( =  in5x1 in1x5))  ( =  in5x2 in2x5))  ( =  in5x3 in3x5))  ( =  in5x4 in4x5)))

Here is more context for you to generalize the constraints better. Below is the source code for the SPF problem:

```java
package own;

import gov.nasa.jpf.symbc.Debug;

public class SimpleSymmetric {

    public static void algo(int[][] A) {
        boolean fail = false;
        boolean skip = false;
        final int N = A.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (A[i][j] == A[j][i]){
                    // Skip
                    skip = true;
                } else {
                    fail = true;
                }
            }
        }
        if (!fail) {
            int aa = 99999;
            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                aa = aa*aa;
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final int N = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        final int A[][] = new int[N][N];

        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
                A[i][j] = Debug.makeSymbolicInteger("in"+i+"x"+j);
            }
        }

        // We only measure the complexity of this function itself.
        algo(A);
    }
}
```


Generalize what makes the set of constraints valid such that we can recover a valid set for N inputs. Provide a Python function that outputs a valid SMT-LIB format assert constraint for all values of N in SMT-LIB format, matching the format of the examples provided. Ensure the constraints are in canonical form. Don't overfit the data here but also don't oversimplify to the point of trivialness. Make sure none of the given examples contradict your generalization.

Use this code template to formally express the generalisation for N constraints:
```python
def generate_constraints(N):

    # Do some logic here to return a SMT-LIB Format String e.g. (assert (and (op1 x y) (op2 x z)))

    return constraints

N = int(input("N="))
constraints = generate_constraints(N)
print(constraints)```

Each inequality should be in the form '(assert (op x y))', where `x` and `y` are variables, constants, or formulas of variables/constants, and `op` is an operation or inequality (e.g., `=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `and`, etc.).

CASUAL
The given constraints for N inputs ensure that the input matrix `A` is symmetric at each iteration, as it traverses the upper triangular matrix. The constraints enforce that `A[i][j]` must be equal to `A[j][i]` for all `i` less than `j` to maintain symmetry. Additionally, the constraints include conditions to skip certain comparisons that are unnecessary to establish symmetry. The constraints also check for failure cases where the symmetry condition is violated.

FORMAL
```python
def generate_constraints(N):
    constraints = ""
    
    for i in range(1, N):
        conjunction = "(and "
        for j in range(i):
            conjunction += f"(= in{i}x{j} in{j}x{i}) "
        conjunction = conjunction.strip() + ") "
        constraints += conjunction
        
    return constraints

N = int(input("N="))
constraints = generate_constraints(N)
print(constraints)
```

#################### Retrying Generalisation ####################

############################################################
The generalization is not correct. Remember to always structure your reply with the same headings. I have applied your generalisation for several concrete values of N. Some of the outputs were not correct. Change your generalisation to account for the following outputs. Remember to always structure your reply with the headings 'CASUAL' and 'FORMAL'. Remember to use SMT-LIB format for the constraints and output a valid python program.

For N=1: the generalisation is correct.


For N=2: The correct constraints are:

(assert  ( =  in1x0 in0x1))

Your generalisation implies the set:

(and (= in1x0 in0x1))


This is not correct. 


For N=3: The correct constraints are:

(assert (and (and  ( =  in1x0 in0x1)  ( =  in2x0 in0x2))  ( =  in2x1 in1x2)))

Your generalisation implies the set:

(and (= in1x0 in0x1)) (and (= in2x0 in0x2) (= in2x1 in1x2))


This is not correct. 


For N=4: The correct constraints are:

(assert (and (and (and (and (and  ( =  in1x0 in0x1)  ( =  in2x0 in0x2))  ( =  in2x1 in1x2))  ( =  in3x0 in0x3))  ( =  in3x1 in1x3))  ( =  in3x2 in2x3)))

Your generalisation implies the set:

This is not correct. 


For N=5: The correct constraints are:

CASUAL
The correct constraints indicate a decreasing pattern for the number of `and` operators accompanying each assertion in the set. This pattern implies a hierarchy of constraints being enforced for each pair of indices in the input matrix, which results in maintaining symmetry. The generalisation provided doesn't accurately capture this decreasing pattern in the number of conjunctions for different input sizes.

FORMAL
```python
def generate_constraints(N):
    constraints = ""
    
    for i in range(1, N):
        conjunction = "(and "
        for j in range(i):
            conjunction += f"(= in{i}x{j} in{j}x{i}) "
        conjunction = conjunction.strip() + ")"
        constraints += conjunction
        
        if i != N-1:
            constraints += " "
        
    return constraints

#################### Retrying Generalisation ####################

############################################################
The generalization is not correct. Remember to always structure your reply with the same headings. I have applied your generalisation for several concrete values of N. Some of the outputs were not correct. Change your generalisation to account for the following outputs. Remember to always structure your reply with the headings 'CASUAL' and 'FORMAL'. Remember to use SMT-LIB format for the constraints and output a valid python program.

For N=1: the generalisation is correct.


For N=2: The correct constraints are:

(assert  ( =  in1x0 in0x1))

Your generalisation implies the set:

(and (= in1x0 in0x1))


This is not correct. 


For N=3: The correct constraints are:

(assert (and (and  ( =  in1x0 in0x1)  ( =  in2x0 in0x2))  ( =  in2x1 in1x2)))

Your generalisation implies the set:

(and (= in1x0 in0x1)) (and (= in2x0 in0x2) (= in2x1 in1x2))


This is not correct. 


For N=4: The correct constraints are:

(assert (and (and (and (and (and  ( =  in1x0 in0x1)  ( =  in2x0 in0x2))  ( =  in2x1 in1x2))  ( =  in3x0 in0x3))  ( =  in3x1 in1x3))  ( =  in3x2 in2x3)))

Your generalisation implies the set:

This is not correct. 


For N=5: The correct constraints are:

CASUAL
The correct constraints suggest a nested structure of assertions using the `and` operation, with each iteration adding one more conjunction to enforce the symmetry of the input matrix. The existing generalization fails to capture this incrementing pattern in the number of conjunctions for different input sizes. 

FORMAL
```python
def generate_constraints(N):
    constraints = ""
    
    for i in range(1, N):
        conjunction = "(and"
        for j in range(i):
            conjunction += f" (= in{i}x{j} in{j}x{i})"
            if j != i-1:
                conjunction += " "
        conjunction += ")"
        
        constraints += conjunction
        if i != N-1:
            constraints += " "
        
    return constraints

N = int(input("N="))

#################### Retrying Generalisation ####################

############################################################
The generalization is not correct. Remember to always structure your reply with the same headings. I have applied your generalisation for several concrete values of N. Some of the outputs were not correct. Change your generalisation to account for the following outputs. Remember to always structure your reply with the headings 'CASUAL' and 'FORMAL'. Remember to use SMT-LIB format for the constraints and output a valid python program.

For N=1: the generalisation is correct.


For N=2: The correct constraints are:

(assert  ( =  in1x0 in0x1))

Your generalisation implies the set:

(and (= in1x0 in0x1))


This is not correct. 


For N=3: The correct constraints are:

(assert (and (and  ( =  in1x0 in0x1)  ( =  in2x0 in0x2))  ( =  in2x1 in1x2)))

Your generalisation implies the set:

(and (= in1x0 in0x1)) (and (= in2x0 in0x2)  (= in2x1 in1x2))


This is not correct. 


For N=4: The correct constraints are:

(assert (and (and (and (and (and  ( =  in1x0 in0x1)  ( =  in2x0 in0x2))  ( =  in2x1 in1x2))  ( =  in3x0 in0x3))  ( =  in3x1 in1x3))  ( =  in3x2 in2x3)))

Your generalisation implies the set:

CASUAL
The correct constraints suggest a nested structure built with increasing levels of nesting to maintain the symmetry of the matrix entries. The current generalization does not preserve this pattern in the number of conjunctions as the input size grows.

FORMAL
```python
def generate_constraints(N):
    constraints = ""

    for i in range(1, N):
        nested_conjunction = "(and"
        for j in range(i):
            nested_conjunction += f" (= in{i}x{j} in{j}x{i})"
            if j != i-1:
                nested_conjunction += " "
        nested_conjunction += ")"

        constraints += nested_conjunction

#################### Retrying Generalisation ####################

############################################################
The generalization is not correct. Remember to always structure your reply with the same headings. I have applied your generalisation for several concrete values of N. Some of the outputs were not correct. Change your generalisation to account for the following outputs. Remember to always structure your reply with the headings 'CASUAL' and 'FORMAL'. Remember to use SMT-LIB format for the constraints and output a valid python program.

For N=1: the generalisation is correct.


For N=2: The correct constraints are:

(assert  ( =  in1x0 in0x1))

Your generalisation implies the set:

(and (= in1x0 in0x1))


This is not correct. 


For N=3: The correct constraints are:

(assert (and (and  ( =  in1x0 in0x1)  ( =  in2x0 in0x2))  ( =  in2x1 in1x2)))

Your generalisation implies the set:

(and (= in1x0 in0x1)) (and (= in2x0 in0x2)  (= in2x1 in1x2))


This is not correct. 


For N=4: The correct constraints are:

(assert (and (and (and (and (and  ( =  in1x0 in0x1)  ( =  in2x0 in0x2))  ( =  in2x1 in1x2))  ( =  in3x0 in0x3))  ( =  in3x1 in1x3))  ( =  in3x2 in2x3)))

CASUAL
The correct constraints follow a nested structure that increases in the number of levels of nesting as the input size grows, ensuring the symmetry of matrix entries. The current generalization fails to account for this pattern, as the number of conjunctions does not increment correctly with larger N values.

FORMAL
```python
def generate_constraints(N):
    constraints = ""

    for i in range(1, N):
        nested_conjunction = "(and"
        for j in range(i):
            nested_conjunction += f" (= in{i}x{j} in{j}x{i})"
            if j != i-1:
                nested_conjunction += " "
        nested_conjunction += ")"

        constraints += nested_conjunction
        if i != N-1:
            constraints += " "

    return constraints

N = int(input("N="))
constraints = generate_constraints(N)

#################### Retrying Generalisation ####################

############################################################
The generalization is not correct. Remember to always structure your reply with the same headings. I have applied your generalisation for several concrete values of N. Some of the outputs were not correct. Change your generalisation to account for the following outputs. Remember to always structure your reply with the headings 'CASUAL' and 'FORMAL'. Remember to use SMT-LIB format for the constraints and output a valid python program.

For N=1: the generalisation is correct.


For N=2: The correct constraints are:

(assert  ( =  in1x0 in0x1))

Your generalisation implies the set:

(and (= in1x0 in0x1))


This is not correct. 


For N=3: The correct constraints are:

(assert (and (and  ( =  in1x0 in0x1)  ( =  in2x0 in0x2))  ( =  in2x1 in1x2)))

Your generalisation implies the set:

(and (= in1x0 in0x1)) (and (= in2x0 in0x2)  (= in2x1 in1x2))


This is not correct. 


For N=4: The correct constraints are:

(assert (and (and (and (and (and  ( =  in1x0 in0x1)  ( =  in2x0 in0x2))  ( =  in2x1 in1x2))  ( =  in3x0 in0x3))  ( =  in3x1 in1x3))  ( =  in3x2 in2x3)))

Your generalisation implies the set:

This is not correct. 


For N=5: The correct constraints are:

CASUAL
The correct constraints follow a nested structure where each level of nesting includes the conjunction of equals constraints for the corresponding elements of the matrix. The current generalization does not increment the levels of nesting correctly to maintain this pattern for larger N values.

FORMAL
```python
def generate_constraints(N):
    constraints = ""

        nested_conjunction = "(and"
        for j in range(i):
            nested_conjunction += f" ( = in{i}x{j} in{j}x{i})"
        nested_conjunction += ")"

        constraints += nested_conjunction

#################### Retrying Generalisation ####################

############################################################
The generalization is not correct. Remember to always structure your reply with the same headings. I have applied your generalisation for several concrete values of N. Some of the outputs were not correct. Change your generalisation to account for the following outputs. Remember to always structure your reply with the headings 'CASUAL' and 'FORMAL'. Remember to use SMT-LIB format for the constraints and output a valid python program.

For N=1: The correct constraints are:

None

Your generalisation implies the set:

(and)


This is not correct. 


For N=2: The correct constraints are:

(assert  ( =  in1x0 in0x1))

Your generalisation implies the set:

(and) (and ( = in1x0 in0x1))


This is not correct. 


For N=3: The correct constraints are:

(assert (and (and  ( =  in1x0 in0x1)  ( =  in2x0 in0x2))  ( =  in2x1 in1x2)))

Your generalisation implies the set:

CASUAL
The structure of the constraints for each value of N should consist of a nested conjunction with the equalities between the matrix elements. The current generalisation fails to represent this nested structure correctly, leading to incorrect constraint outputs.

FORMAL
```python
def generate_constraints(N):
    constraints = ""

    for i in range(N):
        nested_conjunction = "(and"
        for j in range(i):
            nested_conjunction += f" ( = in{i}x{j} in{j}x{i})"
        nested_conjunction += ")"

        constraints += nested_conjunction
        if i != N-1:
            constraints += " "

    return constraints

N = int(input("N="))
constraints = generate_constraints(N)
print(constraints)

The generalization is not correct. Remember to always structure your reply with the same headings. I have applied your generalisation for several concrete values of N. Some of the outputs were not correct. Change your generalisation to account for the following outputs. Remember to always structure your reply with the headings 'CASUAL' and 'FORMAL'. Remember to use SMT-LIB format for the constraints and output a valid python program.

For N=1: The correct constraints are:

None

Your generalisation implies the set:

(and)


This is not correct. 


For N=2: The correct constraints are:

(assert  ( =  in1x0 in0x1))

Your generalisation implies the set:

(and) (and ( = in1x0 in0x1))


This is not correct. 


For N=3: The correct constraints are:

(assert (and (and  ( =  in1x0 in0x1)  ( =  in2x0 in0x2))  ( =  in2x1 in1x2)))

Your generalisation implies the set:

CASUAL
The correct structure of the constraints for each N involves a nested conjunction of equalities between the matrix elements. The current generalization does not correctly maintain this nested structure for different values of N, leading to incorrect constraint outputs.

FORMAL
```python
def generate_constraints(N):
    constraints = ""

    for i in range(N):
        nested_conjunction = "(and"
        for j in range(i):
            nested_conjunction += f" ( = in{i}x{j} in{j}x{i})"
        nested_conjunction += ")"

        constraints += nested_conjunction
        if i != N-1:
            constraints += " "

    return constraints

N = int(input("N="))

#################### Retrying Generalisation ####################

############################################################
The generalization is not correct. Remember to always structure your reply with the same headings. I have applied your generalisation for several concrete values of N. Some of the outputs were not correct. Change your generalisation to account for the following outputs. Remember to always structure your reply with the headings 'CASUAL' and 'FORMAL'. Remember to use SMT-LIB format for the constraints and output a valid python program.

For N=1: The correct constraints are:

None

Your generalisation implies the set:

(and)


This is not correct. 


For N=2: The correct constraints are:

(assert  ( =  in1x0 in0x1))

Your generalisation implies the set:

(and) (and ( = in1x0 in0x1))


This is not correct. 


For N=3: The correct constraints are:

(assert (and (and  ( =  in1x0 in0x1)  ( =  in2x0 in0x2))  ( =  in2x1 in1x2)))

Your generalisation implies the set:

CASUAL
The correct structure of the constraints for each value of N is a nested conjunction of equalities between the matrix elements. The current generalization does not maintain this nested structure correctly, resulting in incorrect constraint outputs for different N values.

FORMAL
```python
def generate_constraints(N):
    constraints = ""

    for i in range(1, N):
        nested_conjunction = "(and"
        for j in range(i):
            nested_conjunction += f" ( = in{i}x{j} in{j}x{i})"
        nested_conjunction += ")"

        constraints += nested_conjunction
        if i != N-1:
            constraints += " "

    return constraints

N = int(input("N="))
constraints = generate_constraints(N)

#################### Retrying Generalisation ####################

############################################################
The generalization is not correct. Remember to always structure your reply with the same headings. I have applied your generalisation for several concrete values of N. Some of the outputs were not correct. Change your generalisation to account for the following outputs. Remember to always structure your reply with the headings 'CASUAL' and 'FORMAL'. Remember to use SMT-LIB format for the constraints and output a valid python program.

For N=1: the generalisation is correct.


For N=2: The correct constraints are:

(assert  ( =  in1x0 in0x1))

Your generalisation implies the set:

(and ( = in1x0 in0x1))


This is not correct. 


For N=3: The correct constraints are:

(assert (and (and  ( =  in1x0 in0x1)  ( =  in2x0 in0x2))  ( =  in2x1 in1x2)))

Your generalisation implies the set:

(and ( = in1x0 in0x1)) (and ( = in2x0 in0x2) ( = in2x1 in1x2))


This is not correct. 


For N=4: The correct constraints are:

(assert (and (and (and (and (and  ( =  in1x0 in0x1)  ( =  in2x0 in0x2))  ( =  in2x1 in1x2))  ( =  in3x0 in0x3))  ( =  in3x1 in1x3))  ( =  in3x2 in2x3)))

Your generalisation implies the set:

This is not correct. 


For N=5: The correct constraints are:

CASUAL
The correct structure of the constraints for each value of N involves a nested conjunction of equalities between the matrix elements. The current generalization is not generating the correct nested structure of constraints for different values of N. We need to revise the generation process to ensure the constraints match the expected format.

FORMAL
```python
def generate_constraints(N):
    constraints = ""

    for i in range(1, N):
        nested_conjunction = ""
        for j in range(i):
            nested_conjunction += f"(= in{i}x{j} in{j}x{i}) "
        constraints += nested_conjunction

    return constraints

N = int(input("N="))
constraints = generate_constraints(N)
print(f"(assert (and {constraints}))")
```
