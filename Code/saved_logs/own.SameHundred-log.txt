I'm experimenting with a program and trying to find what makes an increasingly large set of inputs valid. So far I have found one possible set of correct constraints/conditions (not the only one) which define a valid input. Here they are.

Below is the source code for the SPF problem:

```java
package own;

import gov.nasa.jpf.symbc.Debug;

public class SameHundred {

    public static void algo(int[] a) {
        boolean fail = false;
        boolean skip = false;
        final int N = a.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            if (a[i] < 100){
                // Skip
                skip = true;
            } else {
                fail = true;
            }
        }
        if (!fail) {
            int aa = 99999;
            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                aa = aa*aa;
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final int N = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);

        int a[] = new int[N];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            a[i] = Debug.makeSymbolicInteger("in"+i);
        }

        // We only measure the complexity of this function itself.
        algo(a);
    }
}

```

Generalise what makes the set of constraints valid such that we can recover a valid set for N inputs. Don't overfit the data here but also don't oversimplify to the point of trivialness. Make sure none of the given examples contradict your generalisation.
############################################################
CASUAL:

The program seems to depend on the values of the input array elements being greater than or equal to 100 to execute successfully. The constraints for each input seem to follow a pattern where for N inputs, the N-1th element onwards must be greater than or equal to 100. This means that in1 >= 100 for 2 inputs, in2 >= 100, in1 >= 100 for 3 inputs, and so on until inN-1 >= 100, ... , in2 >= 100, in1 >= 100 for N inputs.

FORMAL:

For a given input array of size N, the valid constraints to make the algorithm execute successfully are:
- For N=1, there are no specific constraints required.
- For N > 1, the constraints are: inN-1 >= 100, inN-2 >= 100, ..., in1 >= 100.

CASUAL:

It seems the correct generalisation for the constraints required to make the algorithm execute successfully should be adjusted. For each N number of inputs, the constraints should start from the last input index (N) and go backwards towards the first input index (1), with each index needing to be greater than or equal to 100.

FORMAL:

For a given input array of size N, the valid constraints to make the algorithm execute successfully are:
- For N=1, there are no specific constraints required.
- For N > 1, the constraints are: inN >= 100, inN-1 >= 100, ..., in2 >= 100, in1 >= 100.

For a given input array of size N, the valid constraints needed for the algorithm to execute successfully are:
- For N=1, there are no specific constraints required.
- For N > 1, the constraints should be: inN >= 100, inN-1 >= 100, ..., in2 >= 100, in1 >= 100.

I have two sets of inequalities over variables. Tell me if these two sets are the same or not, and how they differ if they do. Ignore the order of constraints and differences in formatting (e.g., spaces, newline characters, and exact variable names like 's_0', 's0', 's(0)', '{s_0}' are all the same), though the numbers associated with variable names should be the same. 'There are no constraints' or 'None' is equivalent to the empty set. If the only difference between the two is formatting, then they actually match. They're only different if one set is bigger than the other or if they contain constraints that aren't in the other.

I have a generalisation defining a set of inequalities for a set of variables. The definition is general for an arbitrary N amount of variables. Here is the generalisation:

```
For a given input array of size N, the valid constraints required for the algorithm to execute successfully are:
- For N=1, there are no specific constraints needed.
- For N > 1, the constraints should be: inN >= 100, ..., in2 >= 100, in1 >= 100.

I have two sets of inequalities over variables. Tell me if these two sets are the same or not, and how they differ if they do. Ignore the order of constraints and differences in formatting (e.g., spaces, newline characters, and exact variable names like 's_0', 's0', 's(0)', '{s_0}' are all the same), though the numbers associated with variable names should be the same. 'There are no constraints' or 'None' is equivalent to the empty set. If the only difference between the two is formatting, then they actually match. They're only different if one set is bigger than the other or if they contain constraints that aren't in the other. Try to keep your final reasons short but not generic and without using bullet points or numbered lists.

- Therefore, the two sets are DIFFERENT.

I have a generalisation defining a set of inequalities for a set of variables. The definition is general for an arbitrary N amount of variables. Here is the generalisation:

```
For a given input array of size N, the valid constraints necessary for the algorithm to execute successfully are:
- For N=1, no specific constraints are required.
- For N > 1, the constraints should be: inN >= 100, ... , in2 >= 100, in1 >= 100.
```


Calculate the constraints for N=5.

For N=5, the constraints should be:

I have two sets of inequalities over variables. Tell me if these two sets are the same or not, and how they differ if they do. Ignore the order of constraints and differences in formatting (e.g., spaces, newline characters, and exact variable names like 's_0', 's0', 's(0)', '{s_0}' are all the same), though the numbers associated with variable names should be the same. 'There are no constraints' or 'None' is equivalent to the empty set. If the only difference between the two is formatting, then they actually match. They're only different if one set is bigger than the other or if they contain constraints that aren't in the other. Try to keep your final reasons short but not generic and without using bullet points or numbered lists.

THINKING: 
The 'YOUR CONSTRAINTS' set has one extra inequality compared to the 'SPF CONSTRAINTS' set. The extra inequality is 'in5 >= 100'. Therefore, the sets are DIFFERENT.

DIFFERENT

The 'YOUR CONSTRAINTS' set contains an extra constraint 'in5 >= 100' that is not present in the 'SPF CONSTRAINTS' set.

**THINKING:**  
The first set of constraints includes five inequalities with variables `in6`, `in5`, `in4`, `in3`, `in2`, `in1`. The second set of constraints includes four inequalities with variables `in5`, `in4`, `in3`, `in2`, `in1`. So, the first set has an extra constraint on variable `in6` which the second set does not have.  

**ANSWER:**  
DIFFERENT

############################################################
THINKING:
The constraints in your set are all variables from in1 to in9 greater than or equal to 100. The SPF constraints are all variables from in1 to in8 greater than or equal to 100. From the given constraints, it is clear that the first set has an additional constraint for in9, while the SPF constraints do not have this. Hence, the two sets are different.

ANSWER:
DIFFERENT

REASON:
The two sets do not match because your set contains an additional constraint for in9, which is not present in the SPF constraints.

THINKING
The constraints in 'YOUR CONSTRAINTS' are all inequalities stating that each variable is greater than or equal to 100. The constraints in 'SPF CONSTRAINTS' are also inequalities stating that each variable is greater than or equal to 100, but the first constraint in 'YOUR CONSTRAINTS' involving 'in10 >= 100' is missing in 'SPF CONSTRAINTS'.

ANSWER
DIFFERENT

REASON
The first constraint 'in10 >= 100' in 'YOUR CONSTRAINTS' is missing in 'SPF CONSTRAINTS', making them different.
